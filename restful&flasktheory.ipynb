        "3. **Stateless:** Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand the request.\n",
        "4. **Cacheable:** Responses from the server can be cached by the client to reduce the number of requests.\n",

        "\n",
        "Securing a Flask API involves implementing various measures to protect it from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Here are some ways to secure a Flask API:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Authentication and Authorization**\n",
        "- Use a library like Flask-Login or Flask-Security: These libraries provide authentication and authorization features for Flask applications.\n",
        "- Implement token-based authentication: Use tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to authenticate and authorize users.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Encryption**\n",
        "- Use HTTPS: Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.\n",
        "- Encrypt sensitive data: Use encryption algorithms like AES to encrypt sensitive data stored in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**\n",
        "- Validate user input: Use libraries like WTForms or Marshmallow to validate user input and prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n",
        "- Sanitize user input: Remove any malicious characters or code from user input to prevent XSS attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Rate Limiting**\n",
        "- Use a library like Flask-Limiter: Limit the number of requests from a single IP address to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Error Handling**\n",
        "- Implement error handling: Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions, and return meaningful error messages to users.\n",
        "- Log errors: Log errors and exceptions to track security issues and improve the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Secure Dependencies**\n",
        "- Keep dependencies up-to-date: Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.\n",
        "- Use secure dependencies: Use dependencies that are known to be secure and well-maintained.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Monitor the API**\n",
        "- Use monitoring tools: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the API's performance and security.\n",
        "- Log API activity: Log API activity to track security issues and improve the API.\n"

        "2. **Resourceful Routing:** Flask-RESTful provides resourceful routing, which allows you to map URLs to resources and handle HTTP requests in a structured way.\n",
        "3. **Request and Response Handling:** Flask-RESTful provides features like request parsing and response formatting, which makes it easy to handle requests and responses.\n",
        "4. **Error Handling:** Flask-RESTful provides error handling features that allow you to handle errors in a centralized way.\n",
        "5. **Flexibility:** Flask-RESTful is highly flexible and allows you to customize its behavior to suit your needs.\n"
